      **Hi there! My name is Alba Vidal, audiovisual translator.** “Audiovisual”
      and “Vidal” rhyme in Spanish, but sadly not in English. I will eventually
      come up with something nice to make up for it, I promise!


      **I have over 7 years of experience as a professional translator and
      proofreader. Of those 7, 5 years have been dedicated almost exclusively to
      what I enjoy more than anything in the world: audiovisual translation.**


      I remember being a pre-teen self translating Hilary Duff lyrics for fun.
      And I’m talking pre-internet times, so I used a physical dictionary! With
      pages! I also remember when **I was 18** and had to choose what to study
      after high school, and how I would end up crying because **I couldn’t
      decide between English, Media Studies or Translation**. Well, it turns out
      you can combine all three, and that is what I’ve done.


      After completing my BA in English Studies in Universidad de Oviedo
      (Spain), I moved to London, where I lived for several years. Among the
      many things I did there, I studied an **MA in Audiovisual Translation at
      the University of Roehampton**.


      Fast forward to 2023, and **I have translated over 40 films and TV shows
      into Spanish**. In 2018,\*\* I won an ATRAE award for Best Subtitled TV
      Show\*\* for my translation of RuPaul’s Drag Race.


      Besides **freelance** translation, I have also worked as an in-house
      Linguistic QA specialist for companies such as **Electronic Arts and
      Deluxe Media**. I also collaborate with film festivals as a subtitle
      technician.


      ## Why work with me?


      > But Alba, isn’t ChatGPT just as good as a human translator these days?
      Isn’t the proofreading function in Word enough? Why should I hire a
      professional?


      Translation:


      > But Alba, doesn’t McDonald’s sell cheaper food? Why would I go to a
      Michelin star restaurant, then?


      They are both, in fact, acceptable options. But the choice depends on what
      you are hoping to achieve by translating your product and how far you’d
      like it to go. Are you trying to grow your brand by translating your
      website? Submit your short film to a festival? Do you need subtitling for
      the deaf that really makes media accessible and actually helps its users
      rather than frustrate them? Then, you want to work with a professional who
      understands not only the source and target cultures, but also what your
      goals are, and who helps you get there through translation.
