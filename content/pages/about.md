      # About Me


      Hi there! My name is Alba Vidal, audiovisual translator. “Audiovisual” and
      “Vidal” rhyme in Spanish, but sadly not in English. I will eventually come
      up with something nice to make up for it, I promise!


      I have over 7 years of experience as a professional translator and
      proofreader. Of those 7, 5 years have been dedicated almost exclusively to
      what I enjoy more than anything in the world: audiovisual translation.


      I remember being a pre-teen self translating Hilary Duff lyrics for fun.
      And I’m talking pre-internet times, so I used a physical dictionary! With
      pages! I also remember when I was 18 and had to choose what to study after
      high school, and how I would end up crying because I couldn’t decide
      between English, Media Studies or Translation. Well, it turns out you can
      combine all three, and that is what I’ve done.


      After completing my BA in English Studies in Universidad de Oviedo
      (Spain), I moved to London, where I lived for several years. Among the
      many things I did there, I studied an MA in Audiovisual Translation at the
      University of Roehampton.


      Fast forward to 2023, and I have translated over 40 films and TV shows
      into Spanish. In 2018, I won an ATRAE award for Best Subtitled TV Show for
      my translation of RuPaul’s Drag Race.


      Besides freelance translation, I have also worked as an in-house
      Linguistic QA specialist for companies such as Electronic Arts and Deluxe
      Media. I also collaborate with film festivals as a subtitle technician.
