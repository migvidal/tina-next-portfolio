    introduction: >
      As a **translator**, I work exclusively from English to European Spanish
      (**EN>ES**). This has allowed me to focus on the audiovisual field and
      specialize in it, even though I also offer marketing and generalist
      translation.

                Well, it’s a voice narration of the visual elements we see on
                screen, and it aims to make films and TV more accessible for the
                visually impaired. It’s a beautiful craft, and so necessary. You
                can read more about it here

        bulletpoints:
          - text: ' In addition to translation, I offer full proofreading (spelling, grammar and style) of Spanish originals and translations. Don’t let careless punctuation or odd-sounding calques ruin a good text. As we say in Spain, four eyes see more than two. And yes, I am that annoying friend who walks around pointing at street signs because There’s a missing comma!.'

        bulletpoints:
          - text: >-
              Performing final checks on a localized product before its launch
              is essential to avoid a myriad of possible last minute errors.
          - text: >-
              LQA is more technical and specific than proofreading, and it
              involves tasks such as checking style and clients guides, using
              specific software and implement last minute changes requested by
              the client. The process usually goes beyond the languages we
              speak, having to perform checks on tens of languages we don’t
              know. This is why LQA requires solid linguistic knowledge, as well
              as the skill of knowing where to look and what to look for.
